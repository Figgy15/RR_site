# When submitting invalid data, we expect the user count not to change; when submitting valid data, 
# we expect it to change by 1. We can express this in RSpec by combining the expect method with either 
# the to method or the not_to method. We’ll start with the invalid case since it is simpler; we visit the 
# signup path and click the button, and we expect it not to change the user count:
        expect { click_button submit }.to change(User, :count).by(1)
 # This is for the benefit of the change method, which takes as arguments an object and a symbol and then 
 # calculates the result of calling that symbol as a method on the object both before and after the block. 
 # In other words, the above code calculates User.count from Rails Console.  This happens before and affer
 # the excution of click_button.
